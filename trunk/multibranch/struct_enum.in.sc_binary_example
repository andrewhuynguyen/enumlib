Simple cubic
bulk      # bulk or surf tag indicates a 2D or 3D enumeration (both use 3x3 latt vects)
1. 0 0    # a1 parent lattice vector
0 1. 0    # a2 parent lattice vector
0 0 1.    # a3 parent lattice vector
2           # Number of labels/atom types/colors, i.e., binary, ternary, etc.
2 4        # Range of supercell sizes to enumerate over
.0001    # epsilon, tolerance for finite precision arithmetic
full        # full or part tag:  use full list of labelings? (including incomplete ones)
